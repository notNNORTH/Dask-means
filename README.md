## How to Run Dask-means

### Code with comparative algorithms

- You can run the code in `./src/edu/nyu/unik/expriments/kmeansEfficiency.java` to obtain the runtime of each comparative algorithm.
- You can go to the file `./src/au/edu/rmit/trajectory/clustering/kmeans/keamsAlgorithm.java`, and select your comparative algorithms in function `test_DasKmeans()`.

**Parameter configuration:**

There are seven parameters in the file  `./src/edu/nyu/unik/expriments/kmeansEfficiency.java`. Remember to set the parameters to the correct format before running.

```
paras[0] is the path to spatial vector dataset
paras[1] is the number of clusters (k)
paras[2] is the number of spatial vectors (|D|)
paras[3] is set as the default parameter for "a"
paras[4] is the setting for the output file name
paras[5] is the initial data dimension of the dataset
paras[6] is the terminating data dimension of the dataset.
```

### Cost Model

#### Memory Prediction

The core code for calculating memory overhead is in the function `getAllMemory()` in file `./src/au/edu/rmit/trajectory/clustering/kmeans/keamsAlgorithm.java`. This function will be called during the execution of each comparison algorithm in `test_DasKmeans()`.

Moreover, you can also manually adjust the capacity of leaf nodes in function `experiments()` of file `./src/au/edu/rmit/trajectory/clustering/kmeans/keamsAlgorithm.java`.

#### Runtime Prediction

- You can find all the relevant code for runtime adjustments in `./refinement/`.
- `kmeans-time-total.csv` and `kmeans-time-series.csv` are the training datasets that represent the overall runtime and the time of each iteration, respectively.
- The code for runtime prediction is in the file `main.py`.
- The code for runtime adjustment is in the file `GaussinProcess.py`.
